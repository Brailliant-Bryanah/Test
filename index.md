# Test
## What is this?

This is a test GitHub page. The reason I am creating this is because I want to do some tests with pages. The reason I am using GitHub pages despite not knowing much about coding is that I want to end up using this to create an information document about a game I like to play and I asked one of my friends what I should use and he said GitHub so here I am.
